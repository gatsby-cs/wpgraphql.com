        WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields supports nearly all of the ACF
        (free & pro) fields. Some of the fields, such as Accordion and Tab,
        which are not data fields are not supported. The Clone field needs some
        more assessment to determine if it can properly be supported. Fields
        from 3rd party extensions are not supported out of the box, but we are
        interested in supporting the popular ones.

            Some ACF Field locations are very difficult to map to a GraphQL
            Schema. While we are working on supporting additional location
            rules, some highly contextual rules (such as assigning a Field Group
            to a particular page based on itâ€™s parent) are difficult to support.
            This is because the GraphQL Schema is independant of content in the
            WordPress site, but is representative of possible Types in the
            WordPress site.
